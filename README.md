# Nir's MVVM Control Collection

This is a collection of WPF controls I wrote for various reasons, if there's demand I'll port those controls so they can be used also in "Store Apps"

Currently there are two controls in the library, more will be added over the next day as I move controls I previously published on my blog to here

There is a demo app that shows how to use each control

Reflection Control
---

A decorator (like a border) that displays a reflection of it's child element

Speed Dial Style
---

A style that makes a ProgressBar control look like a car's speed dial
