# Nir's MVVM Control Collection

This is a collection of WPF controls I wrote for various reasons, if there's demand I'll port those controls so they can be used also in "Store Apps"

Currently there are two controls in the library, more will be added over the next day as I move controls I previously published on my blog to here

There is a demo app that shows how to use each control

Adorners Lib
---

A set of controls that let you eaily add adorner-based popups that automatically adjust to your controls

Form Panel
---

A panel that arranges label-field pairs into a nice layout

This panel arranges the child elements so that labels are all the same size and inpt fields are all the same size, with configuable spacing.

It's also possible to have a control with no label (by settings FormPanel.IsStandalone="true") and have a group header that 
spans the entire width of the panel (FormPanel.IsGroupHeader="true")

Reflection Control
---

A decorator (like a border) that displays a reflection of it's child element

Speed Dial Style
---

A style that makes a ProgressBar control look like a car's speed dial
